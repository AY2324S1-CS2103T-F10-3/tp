Project: [Ba]king [Br]ead

[Ba]king [Br]ead is a desktop inventory and recipe book application that allows its users to add ingredients and view the
recipes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI using JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancement Implemented:
* **New Feature:** Added the ability to view specific recipes.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view a specific recipe by using the recipe's unique identifier.
  * Justification: This feature is critical to the working of the product as a user needs to be able to view the steps 
  and ingredients in each recipe.
  * Highlights: This enchancement relied on the UnqiueId class which meant that the Index class from Addressbook3 cannot
  be reused. Much thought had went into considering the implementation and integration of the UniqueId class with this
  command.

* **Enhancement:** Enhanced the UI of the app
  * Updated the styling of the UI, which includes colour scheme, borders and fonts changes.
  * Organised the layout of the UI, splitting the view into an IngredientListPanel and a RecipeListPanel.
  * Implemented the ability for the RecipeListPanel to change from listing recipes to showing a single recipe with full
  details of the recipe
  * Changed the icons of the app to suit the theme of baking
  * Improved the layout of each individual list tile for the ingredient list tile and the recipe list tiles.
